# Rail Fence Cipher

You're going to implement a simple [Rail Fence Cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_fence)

Write a ruby script that takes a string as an argument and encodes it using a Rail Fence Cipher with 3 rails. You can assume no spaces and all input is valid.

Example input/output:

```
[ck@arch rail_fence_cipher]$ ruby rfc.rb WEAREDISCOVEREDFLEEATONCE
WECRLTEERDSOEEFEAOCAIVDEN
```

### Bonus
* Convert your script to NodeJS
* Write an encode function were you can specify the number of rails you want
* Write a decode function
